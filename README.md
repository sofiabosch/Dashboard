## Introduction

The AI4Food project: Artificial Intelligence for the Prevention of Chronic Diseases through Personalized Nutrition, currently active and led by the BidaLab research group, has involved my participation in a dashboard platform designed to give visualisation to the AI4Food database.

The increasing prevalence of diet-related diseases necessitates an enhancement in nutritional guidance. Personalized nutrition endeavors to address this issue by tailoring dietary and lifestyle recommendations to the specific circumstances of each individual. Leveraging the latest advancements in technology and data science, researchers can now automatically gather and analyze extensive datasets from various sources, including wearable and smart devices [1].

For the data visualization component, a DASHBOARD tool has been developed to showcase the data collected during the weight loss intervention period.

To implement the dashboard, the Django web development framework was utilized. Customization and adaptation to display each user's desired content were achieved through the use of HTML, while visual appeal was enhanced employing HTML and CSS.
